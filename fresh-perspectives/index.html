                    <h1>Keyboard Design Evolution</h1>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>What is a Keyboard?</h4>
                                <p>A keyboard is an input device used to enter characters and functions into a computer or other device. It consists of a set of keys that allow the user to type letters, numbers, symbols, and perform other functions. Keyboards are used for a variety of tasks, including word processing, programming, gaming, and controlling computer functions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>When was it First Designed and Used?</h4>
                                <p>The first modern keyboard was designed and used in conjunction with early typewriters. The QWERTY layout, which is the most common keyboard layout in use today, was designed by Christopher Latham Sholes and patented in 1878. The keyboard layout was specifically created to reduce the jamming of typebars in mechanical typewriters by spacing out commonly used letter pairs.</p>

                                <p>The concept of the computer keyboard evolved from these early typewriter designs. The first practical use of a computer keyboard was in the 1940s with the development of early computers like the ENIAC, which used a punch card system for input, and later, the UNIVAC I, which featured a keyboard for direct data entry.</p>

                                <h4>How Many Keys Are There in a Keyboard?</h4>
                                <p>The number of keys on a keyboard can vary depending on the type and model. Standard keyboards typically have:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Full-sized keyboards: Usually 104 to 108 keys.</li>
                                        <li>Laptop keyboards: Typically range from 78 to 85 keys.</li>
                                        <li>Compact or tenkeyless (TKL) keyboards: Often have around 87 keys.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <h4>How Many Categories Are the Keys on a Keyboard Divided Into?</h4>
                                <p>The keys on a keyboard are generally divided into the following categories:
                                    <ul>

                    <h1>Cockroaches</h1>
                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p>Cockroaches are ancient insects that have been around for over 300 million years. There are approximately 4,500 known species of cockroaches worldwide, though only about 30 of these species are considered pests that cohabit with humans.</p>
                    <h4>Anatomy and Physiology:</h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body Structure: Cockroaches have a flattened, oval body with a tough exoskeleton made of chitin. They possess six legs, two antennae, and compound eyes.</li>
                            <li>Size: They vary in size from about 0.1 inches (3 mm) to over 3 inches (8 cm) depending on the species.</li>
                            <li>Wings: Some cockroaches have wings, while others do not. Even winged species are not always proficient flyers,  often preferring to glide or scuttle.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Behavior and Ecology:</h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nocturnal: Cockroaches are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night.</li>
                            <li>Diet: They are omnivores and scavengers, feeding on a wide variety of organic matter, including food scraps, decaying matter, and even glue or soap.</li>
                            <li>Habitat: Cockroaches are highly adaptable and can thrive in diverse environments, from tropical rainforests to human dwellings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reproduction:</h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Egg Capsules: Female cockroaches produce egg cases called oothecae, which contain multiple eggs. The number of eggs per ootheca varies by species.</li>
                            <li>Development: Cockroaches undergo incomplete metamorphosis, consisting of three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Nymphs resemble smaller versions of adults and molt several times before reaching maturity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>Ecological Role:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decomposers: Cockroaches play a crucial role in the ecosystem as decomposers, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Human Impact:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pests: Some species are considered pests due to their association with unsanitary conditions, potential to spread disease, and ability to trigger allergies and asthma in sensitive individuals.</li>
                            <li>Control: Pest control measures include maintaining cleanliness, sealing entry points, and using baits and insecticides.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Adaptability and Resilience:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Survival Skills: Cockroaches are known for their resilience and adaptability. They can survive without food for a month, without water for a week, and can withstand significant radiation doses compared to humans.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Fascinating Facts</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ancient Lineage: Cockroaches have existed since the Carboniferous period, making them one of the oldest groups of insects.</li>
                            <li>Communication: They communicate using chemical signals (pheromones) to find food and mates.</li>
                            <li>Speed: Cockroaches can run up to 3 miles per hour, which helps them evade predators and quickly find food.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Cockroaches are remarkable creatures with a long evolutionary history and an impressive ability to adapt to various environments. While some species are considered pests, their ecological role as decomposers highlights their importance in maintaining ecological balance.</p>
